This project was done for the General Assembly + Wayblazer hackathon. Wayblazer is the first company bringing AI into the travel industry. We used their API to build an app that associated concepts with pictures that users can click on and it would insert those concepts into the API to present hotel results.

There are still some things to finish up with some CSS responsiveness, but we placed second and only had a weekend to build the app.. Not too shabby for 5 developers only halfway through an Immersive Web Development course and one recent UX design grad!

Thanks for checking the project out.
