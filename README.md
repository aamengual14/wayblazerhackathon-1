This project was done for the General Assembly + Wayblazer hackathon. Wayblazer is the first company bringing AI into the travel industry. We used their API to build an app that associated concepts with pictures that users can click on and it would insert those concepts into the API to present hotel results.

There are still some things to finish up with some CSS responsiveness, but we placed second and only had a weekend to build the app.. Not too shabby for 5 developers only halfway through an Immersive Web Development course and one recent UX design grad!

If when submitting there is an error page, it is because the API key is most likely outdated as this was an over the weekend project and the keys were not meant to be used for production apps.

Thanks for checking the project out.
